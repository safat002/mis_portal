# Feature Specification: Permitted Tables Visibility

**Feature Branch**: `002-in-data-management`  
**Created**: 2025-09-26  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "in data management or report builder or dashboard the selected tables for the group (permitted in the user-management group is not showing). if any table is selected form any database it should show those databases as connection and while select the connection should load the permitted table."

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user with specific data permissions, I want to see the database connections and tables that I am authorized to access in the data management, report builder, and dashboard sections, so that I can work with the correct data.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user is assigned to a group with permission to access specific tables from a database, **When** the user navigates to the data management, report builder, or dashboard section, **Then** the database should be listed as an available connection.
2. **Given** a user has selected a database connection, **When** they view the available tables, **Then** only the tables they are permitted to access should be displayed.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a user has no permissions to any tables?
- How does the system handle a database connection that becomes unavailable?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The system MUST display database connections to a user only if the user has permission to access at least one table within that database.
- **FR-002**: When a user selects a database connection, the system MUST load and display only the tables that the user's group is permitted to access.
- **FR-003**: The table visibility MUST be consistent across the data management, report builder, and dashboard modules.
- **FR-004**: The system MUST NOT show tables to a user that they are not explicitly permitted to access.
- **FR-005**: [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What should happen if a user's permissions are changed while they are actively using the system?]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **User Group**: Represents a collection of users with a shared set of permissions.
- **Table Permission**: Defines access rights for a User Group to a specific table in a database.
- **Database Connection**: Represents a connection to a database.
