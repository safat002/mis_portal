# Feature Specification: Connection Visibility for Permitted Users

**Feature Branch**: `001-connection-not-showing`  
**Created**: 2025-09-26
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "The connection is not showing for users who have been given permission in user management."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a system administrator, I want to grant a user permission to a specific connection and have that user be able to see and access it, so that they can perform their required tasks. Currently, even after granting permission, the connection does not appear for the user.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user does not have permission for "Connection A", **When** the user logs in and views their available connections, **Then** "Connection A" is not present in the list.
2. **Given** an administrator grants a user permission to "Connection A", **When** the user refreshes their connection list, **Then** "Connection A" becomes visible and accessible.
3. **Given** a user has permission for "Connection A", **When** an administrator revokes that permission, **Then** "Connection A" is removed from the user's list of visible connections.

### Edge Cases
- What happens if a permission is granted or revoked while the user is actively using the system?
- How does the system handle permissions for a newly created user who has not logged in before?
- What happens if the underlying connection is disabled or deleted after a user has been granted permission to it?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The system MUST only display connections to a user for which they have explicit, active permission.
- **FR-002**: When a user is granted permission to a connection, the system MUST make that connection visible to the user. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should this update occur in real-time, or is a page refresh/re-login acceptable?]
- **FR-003**: When a user's permission for a connection is revoked, the system MUST hide that connection from the user. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should this update occur in real-time, or is a page refresh/re-login acceptable?]
- **FR-004**: System administrators MUST have a clear user interface to view, grant, and revoke connection permissions for any user.
- **FR-005**: The user interface MUST provide clear feedback to the user when their list of available connections is updated. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What form should this feedback take? (e.g., a toast notification, a loading spinner, an on-screen message)]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **User**: Represents a system user. Key attributes include a unique identifier and their current set of permissions.
- **Connection**: Represents a configurable data source or endpoint within the system. Key attributes include a unique identifier and its current state (e.g., active, disabled).
- **Permission**: Represents the explicit link between a User and a Connection, which grants the user access.
